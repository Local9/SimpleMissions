# Simple Missions
Simple Missions is a library intended for ScriptHookVDotNet mod developers that makes creating missions in GTA V a lot easier. 

### [Documentation](https://github.com/Starman0620/SimpleMissions/wiki/Getting-Started)

### Major Features
* Support for all major mission types (Heists, Heist setups, Regular missions and Strangers & Freaks)
* Automatic handling of all major mission components outside of the mission itself. These include (but are not limited to) blips, starting points, mission passed and fail screens and paying the player.
* Full code documentation. If you are confused about what a method does, just hover over it with your mouse in Visual Studio and you'll get a brief description of what it does.
